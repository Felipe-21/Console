'''Radians''' are units of measure based on the value of 2 * PI. There are '''6.283185307179586''' radians in a '''360º''' rotation.



* To convert from radians to degrees: '''degrees = radians * 180 / π''' = radians * 57.2958


* To convert from degrees to radians: '''radians = degrees * π / 180''' = degrees * .017453

* Angle values sent to [[SIN]], [[COS]], [[TAN]], [[ATN]] are measured in radians.


* A program can calculate PI for you using the ATN function: '''π = 4 * ATN(1#)'''
